Router UI 0.7.10

• Supersedes the already shipped 0.7.9.1 candidate with a strictly newer
  updater-visible version because the final payload is materially different.
• Fixes clean installations with no VLESS profile yet configured. Backend
  health checks now report a healthy, disabled state instead of forcing the
  transactional installer to roll back.
• Fixes standalone release validation for the stable unversioned
  `system/update` LuCI route introduced in 0.7.9 while retaining support for
  older version-suffixed Update routes.
• Fixes the VPN service status card appearing twice on LuCI 24.10 Overview by
  installing one canonical status include and removing the obsolete alias.
• Keeps VPN and automatic switching disabled on an unconfigured router and
  does not enroll Tailscale or install AdGuardHome.
• Retains the stable LuCI assets, mandatory verified backups, automatic
  rollback, background update jobs, and routing fixes from Router UI 0.7.9.
